          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-intro" class="desc">
            In the past year, AI writing tools have exploded, but the long-term value of "one-click articles" is troubling. This article examines root causes and offers a more robust editorial writing
            workflow.
          </p>

          <h2 id="blog-post-aiarticle-why1">1. Why "one-click articles" are inherently a poor solution</h2>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-why1-desc">
            Large models excel at summarizing, reorganizing, pattern-matching, and language generation. When we ask "write me an article about XXX," the model often stitches together patterns seen
            during training into text that "looks reasonable." The result is usually low information density, vague arguments, and a lack of originality—readable but not useful.
          </p>

          <h2 id="blog-post-aiarticle-why2">2. The problem isn't the model, it's the role you assign it</h2>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-why2-desc">
            Many treat AI as the author, but content quality is determined by topic selection, information completeness, structure, and editorial choices—tasks for editors and researchers. AI is
            better suited for those "editor/researcher" roles.
          </p>

          <h2 id="blog-post-aiarticle-methods">3. Best approach: make AI the editor, not the writer</h2>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-methods-desc">
            A high-quality AI writing workflow should process information before producing prose. Break writing into stages: decide whether it's worth writing, decompose information, build structure,
            generate by section, and finally polish. This maximizes AI strengths while preserving human judgment.
          </p>

          <h3 id="blog-post-aiarticle-step1">Step 1: Decide if it's worth writing</h3>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-step1-desc">
            First answer: what is the core message? Is there room to expand or reframe it? Are important angles being overlooked? This is topic evaluation—AI can quickly compare and summarize.
          </p>

          <h3 id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2">Step 2: Decompose information instead of generating prose</h3>
          <ul id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2-list">
            <li id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2-item1">Extract core arguments</li>
            <li id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2-item2">Mark key facts and data</li>
            <li id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2-item3">Identify disagreements between sources</li>
            <li id="blog-post-aiarticle-step2-item4">Spot controversial points or gaps</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 id="blog-post-aiarticle-step3">Step 3: Build structure first, then fill content</h3>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-step3-desc">A clear outline is the article's logic map. Have AI generate the outline only, so you can better control direction.</p>

          <h3 id="blog-post-aiarticle-step4">Step 4: Write by section, not all at once</h3>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-step4-desc">Generate each section separately with bounded context and human intervention to avoid logical drift and repetition.</p>

          <h3 id="blog-post-aiarticle-step5">Step 5: Final polishing</h3>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-step5-desc">Once facts and structure are set, use AI for language polishing to increase expression density and unify tone.</p>

          <h2 id="blog-post-aiarticle-longterm">4. Why this method is better for long-term production</h2>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-longterm-desc">
            An editorial workflow produces more stable, scalable output, suits team collaboration, and is better for SEO and professional readers—while preserving human judgment rather than relying
            entirely on AI.
          </p>

          <h2 id="blog-post-aiarticle-value">5. What is AI writing's real value</h2>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-value-desc">The value of AI writing is not replacing authorship, but reducing editorial costs to around 10% of previous levels.</p>
          <p id="blog-post-aiarticle-value-note">When you stop chasing "one-click articles," you'll find content quality improves, writing becomes more efficient, and you regain control over AI.</p>
